						<li>Red birds will head straight down after reaching their max height.

			<p>Applet written by Brian Golden<br>
			This applet is a target shooting game (loosely) based on the popular game 
				<a href="http://www.rovio.com/en/our-work/games/view/1" 
				   target="_blank">Angry Birds</a>, <br>
			and as such I take no credit for any ideas that may resemble those in Angry Birds.<br>
