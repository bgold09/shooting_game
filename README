How to Play

    The object of the game is to hit all of the targets and miss as few times as possible.
    Firing Projectiles
        To fire a projectile, choose an angle and velocity
        You may use either the text boxes or sliders provided to enter values
        Then click "FIRE!" to launch the projectile with the given inputs
        A random bird will be launched each time
    The Birds
        Orange birds are the largest of all birds. They are the easiest to hit a target with!
        Yellow birds will bounce one time after hitting the ground. You might be able to hit a target even if you are short!
        Red birds will head straight down after reaching their max height. Even if you overshoot you still might hit a target!
        Blue birds behave normally, but they are the smallest and are the most difficult to hit with
    Scoring
        You gain 5 points for each target you hit
        You lose 1 point for each time you miss
    Click the reset button to revive the targets and start over with zero points

Applet written by Brian Golden
This applet is a target shooting game (loosely) based on the popular game Angry Birds,
and as such I take no credit for any ideas that may resemble those in Angry Birds.
